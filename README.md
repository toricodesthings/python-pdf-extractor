# ðŸ“„ PDF Page Extractor API

## Overview
A small [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) service that accepts a PDF, extracts a given page range, and returns a new PDF.  
Built with security in mind: limits file size, rejects encrypted PDFs, and blocks risky features like embedded JavaScript.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload a PDF and select page ranges (1-indexed).
- Extracts those pages into a brand-new PDF.
- Configurable via `.env` (CORS, file size, page limits).
- Rejects encrypted PDFs and those with suspicious content.
- Lightweight and container-friendly.
